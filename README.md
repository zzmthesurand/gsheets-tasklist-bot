# gsheets-tasklist-bot
A Discord bot that manipulates google sheets for the purpose of task management.

# Notes
Currently this bot is not generalizable, meaning that the sheets only work with a specific type of spreadsheet. No current plans to make this generalizable, but feel free to do so. If I need to refit this bot to serve another set of tasklists/spreadsheets, then I may consider generalizing this bot.

# Modules needed
- discord.py >= 2.0.0
- discord-py-interactions >= 4.1.0
- discord-py-slash-command >= 3.0.3
- gspread >= 5.3.2
